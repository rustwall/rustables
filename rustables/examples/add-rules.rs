//! Adds a table, two chains and some rules to netfilter.
//!
//! This example uses `verdict accept` everywhere. So even after running this the firewall won't
//! block anything. This is so anyone trying to run this does not end up in a strange state
//! where they don't understand why their network is broken. Try changing to `verdict drop` if
//! you want to see the block working.
//!
//! Run the following to print out current active tables, chains and rules in netfilter. Must be
//! executed as root:
//! ```bash
//! # nft list ruleset
//! ```
//! After running this example, the output should be the following:
//! ```ignore
//! table inet example-table {
//!         chain chain-for-outgoing-packets {
//!                 type filter hook output priority 0; policy accept;
//!                 ip daddr 10.1.0.0/24 counter packets 0 bytes 0 accept
//!         }
//!
//!         chain chain-for-incoming-packets {
//!                 type filter hook input priority 0; policy accept;
//!                 iif "lo" accept
//!         }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Try pinging any IP in the network range denoted by the outgoing rule and see the counter
//! increment:
//! ```bash
//! $ ping 10.1.0.7
//! ```
//!
//! Everything created by this example can be removed by running
//! ```bash
//! # nft delete table inet example-table
//! ```
