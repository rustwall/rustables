//! Safe abstraction for userspace access to the in-kernel nf_tables subsystem.
//! Can be used to create and remove tables, chains, sets and rules from the nftables
//! firewall, the successor to iptables.
//!
//! This library currently has quite rough edges and does not make adding and removing netfilter
//! entries super easy and elegant. That is partly because the library needs more work, but also
//! partly because nftables is super low level and extremely customizable, making it hard, and
//! probably wrong, to try and create a too simple/limited wrapper. See examples for inspiration.
//!
//! Understanding how to use the netlink subsystem and implementing this crate has mostly been done by
//! reading the source code for the [`nftables`] userspace program and its corresponding kernel code,
//! as well as attaching debuggers to the `nft` binary.
//! Since the implementation is mostly based on trial and error, there might of course be
//! a number of places where the forged netlink messages are used in an invalid or not intended way.
//! Contributions are welcome!
//!
